## MVP 1


## MVP 2


## MLP (Minimum Lovable Product)


## Technologies Integrated
* JavaScript - This application was written completely in JavaScript.
* NodeJS - An event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment that is ideal for real-time web applications such as ours.
* [Express](https://github.com/expressjs) - Quick and minimilist framework for node. Selected for its robust routing and speed.
* [Sockets](http://socket.io) -
* [P5](https://p5js.org/get-started/) - JavaScript library that provides pre-defined methods for the construction of shapes. This enabled the canvas and blocks of the 'snake' to be drawn more efficiently.
* [MochaJS](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) - JavaScript test framework for node that enabled us to TDD this application
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - TDD assertion library for node. Chosen as it can easily pair with any javascript testing framework(i.e. Mocha). Allowed the use of matchers such as 'should' and 'expect', which improved the readability of our tests.
